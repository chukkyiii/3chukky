Hey People!
This is my first post of this year, so I am going to try to solve some 
problems in HackerRank. This problem is Forming Magic Squares, here is
the sinopsis: 

We have a 3x3 magic square of integers from 1 to 9. We can replace any digit
`a` with another digit `b` at a cost of `|a-b|` where `a` and `b` can be any
two intergers from 1 to 9. The goal is to rearrange the digits of any magic
square in such a way that the sum of any row, any column, or any diagonal is
equal. 

For example if we have the following magic square:

```
4 8 2
4 5 7
6 1 6
```

We can convert to the following magic square:

```
4 9 2
3 5 7
8 1 6
```


|9 - 8| = 1  
|3 - 4| = 1  
|8 - 6| = 2  
1 + 1 + 2 = 4  
So the total cost is 4.  


<!-- How do we Tackle the problem -->
## How do we tackle the problem?

Lets backtrack; we want to calcalate the minimum cost of the magic square.
How do we do this? First we need to know how we define a magic square. 
Checking the [WikiPage]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square") for
this gives a lot of insight. "Look at the properties of a magic square."

Here is where I learnt about the magic constant `M`, we won't be using it
here but it is a good idea to know it. The magic constant is what the sum 
of any row, column or diagonal must be. calculated by: `M = (n*(n^2+1))/2`
when used in this example of a 3x3 magic square it would give us 15.

From what I have seen, when it comes to a 3x3 magic square, the 5 must be
in the middle of the square. Then we can check the cross on each cross the
two numbers excluding 5 (in the middle) must add to 10. This means, we can
have a 3x3 magic square with the following numbers:
1 across from 9  
2 across from 8  
3 across from 7  
4 across from 6  

### How to get every 3x3 magic square
There is a select amount of 3x3 magic squares that can be formed, all we need
to is check each of these and see our array is valid. The way of getting this,
is by:

> Starting of with a magic square. Lets say [[8, 1, 6,], [3, 5, 7], [4, 9, 2]]
> We need to get every rotation of this square. 
> Then from each rotation we can get every reflection. 
> This would give us every possible 3x3 magic square.

Here is the function: 
```python
import numpy as np
def generateAllMagicSquares():
    magic = [[8, 1, 6,], [3, 5, 7], [4, 9, 2]] 
    rotations = [np.rot90(magic, x) for x in range(4)]
    reflections = [np.flip(x, 1) for x in rotations]
    all_magic_3x3 = rotations + reflections

    return all_magic_3x3
```

... or Here it is (3 dimensional array): 
```
magic = [
        [[8, 1, 6], [3, 5, 7], [4, 9, 2]],
        [[6, 1, 8], [7, 5, 3], [2, 9, 4]],
        [[4, 9, 2], [3, 5, 7], [8, 1, 6]],
        [[2, 9, 4], [7, 5, 3], [6, 1, 8]], 
        [[8, 3, 4], [1, 5, 9], [6, 7, 2]],
        [[4, 3, 8], [9, 5, 1], [2, 7, 6]], 
        [[6, 7, 2], [1, 5, 9], [8, 3, 4]], 
        [[2, 7, 6], [9, 5, 1], [4, 3, 8]],
        ]
```

<!-- Breaking it Down -->
## Breaking it Down
Lets calculate the cost, all we need this function to do is to calculate the
cost between each magic square array and the array itself, and then return the 
cost. Simple!

```python
def getCost(arr, magic_square):
    cost = 0
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            cost += abs(arr[i][j] - magic_square[i][j])
    return cost 
```

Next is the main function itself: `formingMagicSquares()`
The key goal of this function here is to get the smallest cost out of magic
square against the array itself. 

```python
import sys
def formingMagicSquare(s):
    magic = [
            [[8, 1, 6], [3, 5, 7], [4, 9, 2]],
            [[6, 1, 8], [7, 5, 3], [2, 9, 4]],
            [[4, 9, 2], [3, 5, 7], [8, 1, 6]],
            [[2, 9, 4], [7, 5, 3], [6, 1, 8]], 
            [[8, 3, 4], [1, 5, 9], [6, 7, 2]],
            [[4, 3, 8], [9, 5, 1], [2, 7, 6]], 
            [[6, 7, 2], [1, 5, 9], [8, 3, 4]], 
            [[2, 7, 6], [9, 5, 1], [4, 3, 8]],
            ]

    min_cost = sys.maxsize

    for magic_square in magic:
        cost = getCost(s, magic_square)
        min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)
    return min_cost
``` 
min_cost should just be infinity or the largest value possible. from that, we 
can get the cost from each magic square check whether the cost that you just
calculated is the smalled than min_cost! 

There You've done it!

<!-- Forming it together  -->
## Forming it together

Python Solution: 
```python 
import numpy as np
import sys
def generateAllMagicSquares():
    magic = [[8, 1, 6,], [3, 5, 7], [4, 9, 2]] 
    rotations = [np.rot90(magic, x) for x in range(4)]
    reflections = [np.flip(x, 1) for x in rotations]
    all_magic_3x3 = rotations + reflections

    return all_magic_3x3

def getCost(arr, magic_square):
    cost = 0
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            cost += abs(arr[i][j] - magic_square[i][j])
    return cost    

def formingMagicSquare(s):
    magic = [
            [[8, 1, 6], [3, 5, 7], [4, 9, 2]],
            [[6, 1, 8], [7, 5, 3], [2, 9, 4]],
            [[4, 9, 2], [3, 5, 7], [8, 1, 6]],
            [[2, 9, 4], [7, 5, 3], [6, 1, 8]], 
            [[8, 3, 4], [1, 5, 9], [6, 7, 2]],
            [[4, 3, 8], [9, 5, 1], [2, 7, 6]], 
            [[6, 7, 2], [1, 5, 9], [8, 3, 4]], 
            [[2, 7, 6], [9, 5, 1], [4, 3, 8]],
            ]

    min_cost = sys.maxsize

    for magic_square in magic:
        cost = getCost(s, magic_square)
        min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)
    return min_cost

print(formingMagicSquare([[8, 1, 6], [3, 5, 7], [4, 9, 7]]))
```

Go solution:
```go

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func getCost(arr [][]int32, magic_square [3][3]int32) int32 {
	var cost int32 = 0
	for i := 0; i <= 2; i++ {
		for j := 0; j <= 2; j++ {
			cost += int32(math.Abs(float64(arr[i][j] - magic_square[i][j])))
		}
	}
	return cost
}

func formingMagicSquare(s [][]int32) int32 {
	var magic = [8][3][3]int32{
		{{8, 1, 6}, {3, 5, 7}, {4, 9, 2}},
		{{6, 1, 8}, {7, 5, 3}, {2, 9, 4}},
		{{4, 9, 2}, {3, 5, 7}, {8, 1, 6}},
		{{2, 9, 4}, {7, 5, 3}, {6, 1, 8}},
		{{8, 3, 4}, {1, 5, 9}, {6, 7, 2}},
		{{4, 3, 8}, {9, 5, 1}, {2, 7, 6}},
		{{6, 7, 2}, {1, 5, 9}, {8, 3, 4}},
		{{2, 7, 6}, {9, 5, 1}, {4, 3, 8}},
	}

	var min_cost = math.Inf(1)

	for _, magic_square := range magic {
		cost := getCost(s, magic_square)
		min_cost = math.Min(float64(min_cost), float64(cost))
	}
	return int32(min_cost)
}
func main() {
	fmt.Println(formingMagicSquare([][]int32{{2, 5, 4}, {4, 6, 9}, {4, 5, 2}}))
}
