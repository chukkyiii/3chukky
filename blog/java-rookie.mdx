Here is what I have understood so far...

```
layout 
variables
functions
for loops 
formats

other stuff...
```


We are going to create a program which shows 10 multiples of n. 
Going to make use of functions in java just to test my knowledge of java. 

The function needs to be inside a class which has to be the same as
the file name.I am going to call the file `Loops.java` so the class
name is going to be called`Loops`

        ```java
public class Loops {
    ...
}
```

I come from python, so when it came to running code I code 'write it anywhere',
but when it comes to Java we have to run our program thorugh the main function which
looks like:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    ...
    System.out.println()
}
```

Within the main method we can now write our code, for example an output:
`System.out.println('hello world') => 'hello world'`

## Let Us Bake!

We want to have our program output multiples of n, n representing a constant of any number 
so that number does not change through out the program. 

```java
public static void multiples(int n){
    ...
}
```

This will be our function which will be called in our main function. In order for to list 10 
multiples of n, we are going to use a for loop. 

### For Loops

Python:
```python
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```
Java:
```java
for (initialExpression; testExpression; updateExpression) {
    // body of the loop
}

// for example: 

for (int i = 1; i < 10; ++i){
    System.out.println(i)
}
```        

I kinda like the way java looks when writing code despite python being much easier to write with. 

Back on Topic, I want to be able to cycle through each number while multiplying it by n.

```java
for (int i = 1; i < 11; ++i ){
    int x = n * i;
}
```
`x` will represent the product of both `i` and`n`.Now we can output`x`.Just to make everything cleaner 
and easier to understand we can format these varibles within the a string. 

```java
for (int i = 1; i < 11; ++i ){
    int x = n * i;
    System.out.println(String.format("%d x %d = %d", n, i, x));
}
```

`%d` representing an interger ? 

*After some research...*
It means ** Decimal Interger **

You can use these when formating other different data types:

```
%c - character 
%d - decimal interger

there are others...
```

so this is what we have got:
```java
public static void multiples(int n){
    for (int i = 1; i < 11; ++i){
        int x = n * i;
        System.out.println(String.format("%d x %d = %d", n, i, x));
    }
}
```
### Let Start Calling
In order to call our function to write the name of the function we want to call, this applies to every programming language I have written in. 
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    multiples(3);
}
```

    ```
this is the result: 
3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
3 x 3 = 9
3 x 4 = 12
3 x 5 = 15
3 x 6 = 18
3 x 7 = 21
3 x 8 = 24
3 x 9 = 27
3 x 10 = 30   
```

There we go we did it! ðŸŽ‰
