So, for the past two months, I have been working on a simple project which I honestly thought I could do in 
under a 2 weeks, but I guess took longer than 8.  This is just a Reaction test inspired by human benchmark. 
I feel like this is a project worthy of being added to the 'list of projects that I am proud of list', 
I will come up with a a better name for it. I am sorry. 

I made a mockup on XD, which wasn't too bad, in fact I really like it and stuck to the design, which 
I promise I will show you an in depth, in the next part. 

Most of the design was easy to implement into code...
That was until we had to start implementing logic, things started turned into a ~~brainfuck~~  mess. 
I mean don't get me wrong I learnt a lot of new things (insert example here). On a general note, 
I used next.js to make this, coming from gatsby there was practically little difference.  

Shout out to `ookey#2767` who made [Typetest.io](http://Typetest.io) huge inspiration, mostly inspired the design. 
The reaction time thing was from human benchmark, just wanted to make my own spin on it. 

### Any Cool Features?

Haha, No not that know of anyway, I feel like the `Sign In With Discord`  
which was pretty cool when I got it to work. Oh! and the graph the graph does not look or
function the way I want to right now, (Still cool though!) but it in the next few commits will sort that out. 

### Contribute!
The project should be open source since I want people to contribute 
but there are files that should not publicly seen. So for now it's staying hidden.

Here You Go.
