So, for the past two months, I have been working on a simple project which I honestly thought I could
do in under 2 weeks, but I guess took longer than 8. This is just a Reaction test inspired by a human
benchmark. I feel like this is a project was worthy of being added to the 'list of projects that I am
proud of' list, I will come up with a better name for it. I am sorry. 

I made a mockup on XD, which wasn't too bad I like it and stuck to the design, which I promise I will
show you in-depth, in the next part. 

Most of the design was easy to implement into code...
That was until we had to start implementing logic, and things started turning into a mess. I mean don't
get me wrong I learnt a lot of new things (insert example here). On a general note, I used next.js to make
this, coming from gatsby there was practically little difference from what I have seen so far.    

Shout out to `ookey#2767` who made [Typetest.io](http://Typetest.io) a huge inspiration, and mostly inspired
by the design. 

### Any Cool Features?

No not that know of anyway, I feel like the `Sign In With Discord`  
which was pretty cool when I got it to work. Oh! and the graph does not look or function the way I want it to
right now, (Still cool though!) but it in the next few commits will sort that out. 

### Contribute!
The project should be open source since I want people to contribute 
but some files should not be publicly seen. So for now it's staying hidden.

Here You Go.
