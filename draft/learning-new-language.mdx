title: "Learning A New Language"

Learning a new language can be tough, My most recent language that I have learnt is Javascript, 
I always had that Javascript was just a language every one knew, I had learnt it earlier on in my
early days of coding, but never to the level at which on know now.

Recently a learnt how to use a static site generator called gatsby which I got the hang of. Fell into 
one continuous problem with useStaticQuery feature which forced me to start my project again. Besides the 
point without Javascript and would never have access to these different projects and frameworks, I can take 
apart of. 

In a way, I am a python fanboy, I mostly understand and feel at home working with python, this is also the reason
why I found it very hard to move to another programming language due to the fact that I wanted to pour all my knowledge 
and experience into python. After a bit of time I felt this was holding me back, I felt this expecially when doing my 
NEA (non-exam assesment) for my a-level exams where I felt absolulty stumped for ideas and most of my projects had me thinking
one thing: 

*** Is Possible to do it in python *** 

Despite the fact that i Belive that a programming language does not hold back your ability to create a project it depends on the 
amount of time you are going to pour into that project or Idea you have, because theere may be a project out there that is helps 
your porject or has a similar basis to your project, but the only thing thats holding you back is that it may be in another 
language...

That Should not hold you back, in fact it should allow you to find an excuse to learn something new. blah blah blah
